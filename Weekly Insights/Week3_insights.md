# Week 3 Training Insights

## Overview
This week, I focused on Angular and explored various aspects of building an application, including the app component's HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and some essential terminal commands. I also worked on creating tables and integrating Bootstrap for styling.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Understanding the structure and components of Angular applications.
  - **Solution:** Spent additional time reviewing Angular documentation and following tutorials to grasp the framework's architecture.
  
- **Challenge:** Integrating Bootstrap with Angular components.
  - **Solution:** Experimented with different Bootstrap classes and reviewed examples to understand how to effectively use Bootstrap's grid system.

- **Challenge:** Terminal commands for Angular.
  - **Solution:** Noted down common commands to improve efficiency and reduce errors during development.

## Code Base
- Implemented a basic Angular application structure.
- Created an app component with:
  - HTML for layout.
  - CSS for styling.
  - TypeScript for functionality.
- Developed a simple table to display data.

## Scope of Improvement
- **Deepen Understanding of TypeScript:** Focus on TypeScript features like interfaces and generics to enhance code quality.
- **Improve Bootstrap Skills:** Explore more complex Bootstrap components such as modals and carousels.
- **Practice Terminal Commands:** Regularly practice to become more proficient with Angular CLI commands.

## Strengths
- **Quick Adaptation to New Technologies:** Was able to learn and implement Angular and Bootstrap effectively within a short time.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Identified challenges and actively sought solutions through experimentation.

## Looking Forward
- **Expand Knowledge of Angular:** Plan to dive deeper into Angular routing and services in the coming weeks.
- **Build More Complex Components:** Aim to create more UI components that leverage both Angular and Bootstrap.
- **Collaborate with Peers:** Look forward to sharing insights and learning from others in the training group.
