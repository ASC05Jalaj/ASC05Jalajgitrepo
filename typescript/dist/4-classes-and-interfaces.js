//TypeScript supports both classes and interfaces.
//These features allow you to create blueprints for objects and enforce a consistent structure in your code.
//Similarly, Java also uses classes and interfaces to define object blueprints and ensure code organization.
//Interfaces in TypeScript define the shape of an object by specifying the types of its properties
